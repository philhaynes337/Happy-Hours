Summary
-----------------
This app was created to mainly help track the hours and overtime for salaried employees. Non-salaried can also track. It tracks the hours and adds up the balance over any time worked over 40 hours. Any time over 40 hours these hours go towards your "Happy Hours" time you should get off! The system also tracks if the salaried employee has any bonus money for that day.
